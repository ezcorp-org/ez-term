# Test Shell Integration

## ✅ Installation Complete

**Binary**: `~/.local/bin/ez` (v0.1.0)
**Wrapper**: `~/work/ez-term/ez.zsh` (for zsh)

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Source the wrapper

In your terminal:
```zsh
source ~/work/ez-term/ez.zsh
export OLLAMA_HOST="http://192.168.0.199:11434"
```

### Step 2: Test command generation

```zsh
ez "find large files"
```

### Expected Output:

```
🤖 Generating command...

💡 Finds all regular files in the current directory and subdirectories
   that are larger than 100MB and displays their paths.

📋 Generated command:
   find . -type f -size +100M -print

$ find . -type f -size +100M -print█
```

**The command will appear in your terminal prompt!** You can then:
- Press **Enter** to execute it
- **Edit** it before running
- Press **Ctrl+C** to cancel

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Zsh (using `print -z`)

The `print -z` command pushes text onto the zsh editor buffer stack. This makes the command appear as if you typed it yourself.

### For Bash (using `history -s`)

Bash doesn't have an equivalent to `print -z`, so the command is added to history. Press **UP ARROW** to retrieve it.

## 📊 New JSON Format

The LLM now returns:
```json
{
  "command": "find . -type f -size +100M -print",
  "description": "Finds all regular files..."
}
```

This gives you context about what the command does before you run it!

## 🔍 More Examples

```zsh
# Disk usage
ez "show disk space"
# Output: df -h

# Git operations
ez "show recent commits"
# Output: git log --oneline -10

# File search
ez "list markdown files"
# Output: find . -type f -name "*.md" -print
```

## ✨ Benefits

1. **See description** - Understand what the command does
2. **Command injection** - Appears in your terminal ready to run
3. **Edit before running** - Full control over execution
4. **Safety first** - Preview mode by default

## 🚀 Ready!

Just run:
```zsh
source ~/work/ez-term/ez.zsh
export OLLAMA_HOST="http://192.168.0.199:11434"
ez "your request here"
```

The command will magically appear in your terminal! ✨
