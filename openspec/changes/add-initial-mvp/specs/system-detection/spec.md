- **THEN** the system SHALL report total and available memory

#### Scenario: Resource detection failure
- **WHEN** resource information cannot be obtained
- **THEN** the system SHALL omit that information rather than failing

### Requirement: Context Formatting
The system SHALL format system information for inclusion in LLM prompts.

#### Scenario: Generate system context string
- **WHEN** preparing a prompt for the LLM
